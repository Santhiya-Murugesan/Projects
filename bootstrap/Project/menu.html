                <h2>Traditional Excursion Tour</h2>
                <p>Dynamic, rich, full of new knowledge and experiences, this can be a hike on any route, regardless of the country or location, if you add to your narration some appropriate jokes, interesting facts and good mood. With 30-40 people under the guidance of one guide with a loudspeaker you really won´t be able to take a rest.</p>

                <h2>Pilgrimage</h2>
                <p>If a person underreacts to all suggestions and comes to life only hearing the words “temple”, “Mecca” or “Islam”, you can organize a trip to the holy places, for example, in the Egyptian monastery of St. Catherine or religious monuments in Cairo. One small thing is missing. This service performed by a private guide is rather of the exclusive services category and therefore has its respective price.</p>

                <h2>Sport and Extreme Tour</h2>
                <p>Extreme tourism (also often referred to as shock tourism, although both concepts do not appear strictly similar) is a niche in the tourism industry involving travel to dangerous places (mountains, jungles, deserts, caves, canyons, etc.) or participation in dangerous events. Extreme tourism overlaps with extreme sport.</p>
