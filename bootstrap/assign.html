                <h2>Taj Mahal</h2>
                <p>Dynamic, rich, full of new knowledge and experiences, this can be a hike on any route, regardless of the country or location, if you add to your narration some appropriate jokes, interesting facts and good mood. With 30-40 people under the guidance of one guide with a loudspeaker you really won´t be able to take a rest.</p>

                <h2>Golden Temple</h2>
                <p>If a person underreacts to all suggestions and comes to life only hearing the words “temple”, “Mecca” or “Islam”, you can organize a trip to the holy places, for example, in the Egyptian monastery of St. Catherine or religious monuments in Cairo. One small thing is missing. This service performed by a private guide is rather of the exclusive services category and therefore has its respective price.</p>

                <h2>Mysore Palace</h2>
                <p>Be the vacation ever so cool in your dream, wherever this corner of paradise may be, and no matter how unrealistic plans may seem, believe those are achievable! Especially if it is made by a private guide, one of those who posted their portfolio at the Private Guides site. Do not be afraid to dream, and people of this creative profession will help you to realize your plans!</p>
