        <h1>Forest</h1>
        <p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees.Hundreds of definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing, and ecological function. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban use."</p>
        <h1 class="black-text green-text">Types of Forest</h1>
        <p>Forests provide home for different plants and animals, they provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as a tourist attraction to man and they also beautify his environment. Forest on the planet can be divided into three major types. They are tropical forests, temperate forests, and boreal forests.</p>
        <h1 class="black-text green-text" id="orangeText" style="color: blue;">Importance of Forest</h1>
        <p>The importance of forests cannot be underestimated. We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use. Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change.</p>
