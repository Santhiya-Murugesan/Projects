            Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus, and it has been observed since prehistoric times. It was named after the Roman god Jupiter, the king of the gods.

        <h3>Name and Symbol</h3>
        <p> In both the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, Jupiter was named after the chief god of the divine pantheon: Zeus for the Greeks and Jupiter for the Romans. The International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally adopted the name Jupiter for the planet in 1976. The IAU names newly discovered satellites of Jupiter for the mythological lovers, favourites, and descendants of the god. The planetary symbol for Jupiter, ♃, descends from a Greek zeta with a horizontal stroke, ⟨Ƶ⟩, as an abbreviation for Zeus.Jove, the archaic name of Jupiter, came into use as a poetic name for the planet around the 14th century.[19] The Romans named the fifth day of the week diēs Iovis ("Jove's Day") after the planet Jupiter.In Germanic mythology, Jupiter is equated to Thor, whence the English name Thursday for the Roman dies Jovis.The original Greek deity Zeus supplies the root zeno-, which is used to form some Jupiter-related words, such as zenographicJovian is the adjectival form of Jupiter. The older adjectival form jovial, employed by astrologers in the Middle Ages, has come to mean "happy" or "merry", moods ascribed to Jupiter's influence in astrology.</p>
