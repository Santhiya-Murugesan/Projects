                <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
                <p>Education can be thought of as the transmission of the values and accumulated knowledge of a society. In this sense, it is equivalent to what social scientists term socialization or enculturation. Children—whether conceived among New Guinea tribespeople, the Renaissance Florentines, or the middle classes of Manhattan—are born without culture. Education is designed to guide them in learning a culture, molding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role in society. In the most primitive cultures, there is often little formal learning—little of what one would ordinarily call school or classes or teachers. Instead, the entire environment and all activities are frequently viewed as school and classes, and many or all adults act as teachers. As societies grow more complex, however, the quantity of knowledge to be passed on from one generation to the next becomes more than any one person can know, and, hence, there must evolve more selective and efficient means of cultural transmission. The outcome is formal education—the school and the specialist called the teacher.</p>
                <h3>FORMAL EDUCATION</h3>
                Formal education or formal learning usually takes place in the premises of the school,
where a person may learn basic, academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend
a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in elementary school and
continues with secondary school.
Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a college or university
which may grant an academic degree. It is associated with a specific or stage and is
provided under a certain set of rules and regulations.
The formal education is given by specially qualified teachers they are supposed to be
efficient in the art of instruction. It also observes strict discipline. The student and the
teacher both are aware of the facts and engage themselves in the process of education. <P></div>
