                <h3>Main Characters</h3>
                <p><ul><li>Oswald (voiced by Fred Savage in the US dub and Richard Pearce in the UK dub) is the main character (four arms, four legs) who lives in an apartment complex with Henry the Penguin and several other animals including a turtle named Buster. A very gentle, polite and big-hearted anthropomorphic blue octopus, Oswald is always willing to go out of his way to help his friends. His favorite hobbies are playing the piano and singing.</li>
                <li>Weenie (voiced by Debi Derryberry) is Oswald's pet dachshund. Weenie bears a strong resemblance to a hot dog and only communicates in "bark-speak". Weenie accompanies Oswald everywhere he goes, and her favorite food is vanilla dog biscuits.</li>
            <li>Henry (voiced by David Lander in the US dub and David Holt in the UK dub) is Oswald's downstairs neighbor and best friend. Henry is a creature of habit in every way and usually shuns the idea of trying different things, though he can sometimes be persuaded otherwise. He tries his best to maintain a rigid schedule. He takes care of his extensive spoon collection, he watches "Penguin Patrol" every evening, and he does the Penguin Polka before bedtime. Most of Henry's favorite foods are fish-flavored and he is a proven expert on snow. He has an identical cousin from the frozen north named Louie, and on occasion speaks of an Aunt Arctica. His motto is "slow and steady". He always takes two (used to be three) marshmallows in his hot cocoa, saying "No more, no less". He also hates getting wet.</li>
        <li>Daisy (voiced by Crystal Scales in the US dub and Mor Leslie in the UK dub) is a tall orange/yellow/green daisy. Free-spirited and energetic yet clumsy, Daisy participates in sports and other activities. She is a close friend of both Oswald and Henry; the three of them often go on adventures together. Daisy loves sunflower sundaes, riding her unicycle, has a large leaf collection and loves peppermint tea. Daisy is very excitable and often has to be hushed by Oswald when she speaks too loudly.</li></ul></p>

                <h3>Lost-Oswald</h3>
                <p>Oswald the Lucky Rabbit was created by Disney and animator Ub Iwerks for Universal. They produced 26 "Oswald" cartoons, but lost the rights to the character in a contract dispute with the studio. Universal continued to produce "Oswald" cartoons while Disney and Iwerks went on to create Mickey Mouse.</p>

                <p class="position">Oswald is a safety-conscious but fun-loving octopus who lives in an apartment complex in Big City with his dog, Weenie. His neighborhood is peopled with colorful characters like his pal, Henry the Penguin, Madame Butterfly, who runs the Big Diner, and her daughter, Catrina Caterpillar. Oswald likes to play the piano and sing, and he always does whatever he can to help his friends and neighbors.</p>

                <h3>Reason for Oswald loss</h3>
                <p>After Universal executives complained that Oswald looked “too old,” Iwerks redesigned him to look younger for the second short, Trolley Troubles (1927). It became the first of 26 Oswald shorts created by Disney's studio for producer Mintz and distributor Universal.</p>
