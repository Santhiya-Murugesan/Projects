        <p style="color: rgb(58, 7, 105); font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;">Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence.
            Science is a systematic endeavor that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.
            Modern science is typically divided into three major branches:natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), 
            which study the physical world; the social sciences (e.g., economics, psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies;
            and the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer science), which study formal systems, governed by axioms and rules.
            There is disagreement whether the formal sciences are science disciplines,because they do not rely on empirical evidence.
            Applied sciences are disciplines that use scientific knowledge for practical purposes, such as in engineering and medici</p>
            <p style="background-color: bisque; color: brown;">Science is the pursuit and application of knowledge and understanding of the natural and social world following a systematic methodology based on evidence. Scientific methodology includes the following: Objective observation: Measurement and data (possibly although not necessarily using mathematics as a tool) Evidence.</p>
