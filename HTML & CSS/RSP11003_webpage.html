                <div><p style="text-align: justify; color: brown;"> Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes, like the Sun , the Moon , the planets, and the stars . It also includes objects we can only see with telescopes or other instruments, like faraway galaxies and tiny particles.Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets.</p>

                    <p style="color: brown;"> Until the invention of the telescope and seminal discoveries in physics related to motion and gravity,  astronomy was primarily concerned with noting and predicting the positions of the sun, moon, and planets, originally for calendrical and astrological purposes and later for navigational uses and scientific interest. In recent times, the study has branched out to several categories, which are distinguished in order of increasing distance, the solar system, the stars that make up the Milky Way galaxy, and other, more distant galaxies. With the advent of scientific space probes, Earth also has come to be studied as one of the planets, though its more detailed investigation remains the domain of the Earth sciences.</p>
